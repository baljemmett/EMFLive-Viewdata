Rough sketch of a potential call flow for reminder service:

- "Welcome to the EMF 2024 reminder call service."
- if user has reminders already set:
  - "You have $n reminders set.  To set a new reminder, please press 1.  To review or cancel existing reminders, press 2.  To cancel all reminders, press 3."
  - 1 -> fall through to set flow
  - 2 -> go to modify flow
  - 3 -> go to cancel-all flow
  - 9 -> go to disable flow (???)
  - 15 second timeout -> go to finish flow
  - otherwise -> "I'm sorry, that response was not recognised." and repeat this branch
- set flow:
  - "Please enter your desired reminder call time, as four digits using the 24-hour clock, or press star followed by the six-digit reminder code for an event."
  - get digit
  - if star, go to event flow
  - get three digits
  - 15 second timeout -> "I'm sorry, that response was not recognised." and repeat flow
  - parse four digit time
  - if failed -> "I'm sorry, that time is not valid." and repeat flow
  - check already set -> "You have already set a reminder for that time" and repeat flow
  - "You have asked to set a reminder for $time; please press 1 to confirm, or hang up to cancel"
  - 1 -> save, go to finish flow
  - 15 second timeout -> go to finish flow
- event flow:
  - get six digits
  - 15 second timeout -> "I'm sorry, that response was not recognised." and go to set flow
  - look up six-digit code
  - not found -> "I'm sorry, that reminder code was not recognised" and go to set flow
  - check already set -> "You have already set a reminder for that event" and go to set flow
  - "You have asked to set a reminder for the event entitled $title; please press 1 to confirm, or hang up to cancel"
  - 1 -> save, finish flow
  - 15 second timeout -> go to finish flow
- modify flow:
  - "You have the following reminders set."
  - read next reminder
  - "Press 1 to continue, or 2 to delete this reminder."
  - 2 -> delete it, "That reminder has been cancelled."
  - 1, or ?? second timeout -> loop until done
  - go to finish flow
- cancel-all flow:
  - "Please press 3 to confirm."
  - 3 -> delete all
  - go to finish flow
- finish flow:
  - "Thank you for using the EMF 2024 reminder call service from microwavepizza.  You can call back at any time to add, review or cancel your reminders."
